A perfect number is a number for which the sum of its proper divisors is 
exactly equal to the number. For example, the sum of the proper divisors of 28 
would be 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 = 28, which means that 28 is a perfect number.

A number n is called deficient if the sum of its proper divisors is less than n and 
it is called abundant if this sum exceeds n.

Find the sum of all the positive integers which cannot be written as the sum of 
two abundant numbers.
