# Euler Problem 4
	# A palindromic number reads the same both ways. 
	# The largest palindrome made from the product 
	# 	of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.
	# Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

# Zinn's thoughts
	# 1. recreate logic with two digit numbers
	# 2. work backwords from 99 (or 999)
	# 3. loop through until a match is found.
